<p>
  An object based tree widget with persistence using cookies that works in ie5 and mozilla.
</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>
  Among the first things I created with DHTML was a tree view, that was over four years ago
  (spring 1997), since then a lot has happened in the browser market, and also with my skills in
  JavaScript and DHTML. Today I give you the third version of this tree view widget. The idea
  behind it is the same as in the first version, to emulate the tree widget found in many modern
  graphical operation environments, such as Microsoft Windows, and so is the basic idea of how to
  accomplish this, to toggle the display property of elements depending on the expanded state of
  their parents. However the similarities stop there. Another thing I can mention from a
  historical point of view is that this is the first complex script that I have created that
  works under two different browsers without the use of browser detection, the same code is
  actually used for ie5 and mozilla. :o)
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  This new version is based on objects, so you do not create the actual html code for the tree
  yourself, you create an object (the tree's root folder) and then you add child items to this.
  Once you're done adding items the actual html code is generated and inserted into the page.
  This makes it very easy to create and update the content of the tree (or to dynamically
  generate it). If you've seen Erik's new xMenu you will notice that it's working in similar
  way.
</p>

<h3>Persistence</h3>

<p>
  This script also features persistence using per session cookies. So now if you go to a page
  using this tree widget, expand a few folders and then leave the page again (by following a
  link or by typing a new url manually) it will store the state of each folder in a cookie so
  when you go back to the page it will remember what folders you last had opened and open them
  for you. This could be very useful if you use this for site navigation etc.
</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>
  The persistence functionality is using the node creation order to remember the state of each node,
  this works fine for static trees, but not for dynamic ones since adding and/or deleting
  nodes will change the original order numbering.
